## Web-Check.xyz

**Web-Check.xyz** is an online tool that provides information about the technologies, frameworks, and versions being used by a website. It can be extremely useful during the **reconnaissance phase** of penetration testing, as it helps you identify what kind of software and services the target website is running. This can give you clues on how to exploit potential vulnerabilities based on known weaknesses in specific versions or technologies.

### Features of Web-Check.xyz:
- **Identify Server Information**: Provides server version details (Apache, Nginx, etc.), which can help in identifying potential vulnerabilities.
- **Technologies in Use**: Detects frameworks like WordPress, Laravel, or Django and their versions, which can be useful for version-specific attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, RCE).
- **Security Features**: Helps identify security features such as headers or known vulnerabilities related to the technology stack.

### Example Use Case:
I used Web-Check.xyz during a penetration test to identify the underlying technology of a target web application. The tool detected an outdated version of **Apache HTTP Server**, which led me to perform further enumeration to check for known **Apache vulnerabilities**.
